!!! note

    **mp-units** usage example applications are meant to be built on all of
    [the supported compilers](../getting_started/cpp_compiler_support.md).
    This is why they benefit from the [Wide Compatibility](../users_guide/use_cases/wide_compatibility.md) mode.

!!! tip

    All usage examples in this chapter are categorized with appropriate tags to simplify
    navigation and search of relevant code. You can either read all the examples one-by-one in
    the order provided by the documentation authors or, thanks to the tagging system, jump
    straight to the example that is the most interesting for you.
