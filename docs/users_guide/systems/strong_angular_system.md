# Strong Angular System

## Some background information

As per today's SI, both radian and steradian are dimensionless. This forces the convention
to set the angle `1 radian` equal to the number `1` within equations (similar to what
natural units system does for `c` constant).

Following [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#Dimensional_analysis):

!!! quote "Wikipedia: Radian - Dimensional analysis"

    Giacomo Prando says "the current state of affairs leads inevitably to ghostly appearances
    and disappearances of the radian in the dimensional analysis of physical equations."
    For example, a mass hanging by a string from a pulley will rise or drop by $y=rθ$
    centimeters, where $r$ is the radius of the pulley in centimeters and $θ$ is the
    angle the pulley turns in radians. When multiplying $r$ by $θ$ the unit of radians
    disappears from the result. Similarly in the formula for the angular velocity of
    a rolling wheel, $ω=v/r$, radians appear in the units of $ω$ but not on the right
    hand side. Anthony French calls this phenomenon "a perennial problem in the teaching
    of mechanics". Oberhofer says that the typical advice of ignoring radians during
    dimensional analysis and adding or removing radians in units according to convention
    and contextual knowledge is "pedagogically unsatisfying".

At least a dozen scientists have made proposals to treat the radian as a base unit of
measure defining its own dimension of "angle", as early as 1936 and as recently as 2022.
This would bring the advantages of a physics-based, consistent, and logically-robust
unit system, with unambiguous units for all physical quantities. At the same time the
only notable changes for typical end-users would be: improved units for the quantities
_torque_, _angular momentum_, and _moment of inertia_.

Paul Quincey in his proposal
[_"Angles in the SI: a detailed proposal for solving the problem"_](../../appendix/references.md#Quincey)
states:

!!! quote "Paul Quincey: Angles in the SI: a detailed proposal for solving the problem"

    The familiar units assigned to some angular quantities are based on equations that
    have adopted the radian convention, and so are missing `rad`s that would be present
    if the complete equation is used. The physically-correct units are those with the
    `rad`s reinstated. Numerical values would not change, and the physical meanings of
    all quantities would also be unaffected.

He proposes the following changes:

- The **radian** would become either a new base unit or a 'complementary' unit
- The **steradian** would become a derived unit equal to $1\:rad^2$
- The SI units for

    - _Torque_ would change from $N\:m$ ($=J$) to $J\:rad^{-1}$
    - _Angular momentum_ would change from $J\:s$ to $J\:s\:rad^{-1}$ (i.e. $J/(rad/s)$)
    - _Moment of inertia_ would change from $kg\:m^2$ to $kg\:m^2\:rad^{-2}$ (i.e. $J/(rad/s)^2$)

- The option to omit the radian from the SI units for _angle_, _angular velocity_,
  _angular frequency_, _angular acceleration_, and _angular wavenumber_ would be removed,
  the only correct SI units being $rad$, $rad/s$, $rad/s$, $rad/s^2$ and $rad/m$ respectively.

Paul Quincey summarizes that with the above in action:

!!! quote "Paul Quincey: Angles in the SI: a detailed proposal for solving the problem"

    However, the physical clarity this would build into the SI should be recognised
    very quickly. The units would tell us that $torque \times angle = energy$, and
    $angular\:momentum \times angle = action$, for example, in the same way that they
    do for $force \times distance = energy$, $linear\:momentum \times distance = action$,
    and $radiant\:intensity \times solid\:angle = radiant\:flux$.
    Dimensional analysis could be used to its full extent. Software involving angular
    quantities would be rationalised. Arguments about the correct units for frequency
    and angular frequency, and the meaning of the unit $Hz$, could be left behind.
    The explanation of these changes would be considerably easier and more rewarding
    than explaining how a kilogram-sized mass can be measured in terms of the Planck
    constant.


## Angular quantities in the SI

Even though the SI somehow ignores the dimensionality of angle:

!!! quote "SI Brochure"

    Plane and solid angles, when expressed in radians and steradians respectively, are
    in effect also treated within the SI as quantities with the unit one. The symbols
    $rad$ and $sr$ are written explicitly where appropriate, in order to emphasize that,
    for radians or steradians, the quantity being considered is, or involves the plane
    angle or solid angle respectively. For steradians it emphasizes the distinction
    between units of flux and intensity in radiometry and photometry for example.
    However, it is a long-established practice in mathematics and across all areas of
    science to make use of $rad = 1$ and $sr = 1$. For historical reasons the radian
    and steradian are treated as derived units.

It also explicitly states:

!!! quote "SI Brochure"

    The SI unit of frequency is hertz, the SI unit of angular velocity and angular
    frequency is radian per second, and the SI unit of activity is becquerel, implying
    counts per second. Although it is formally correct to write all three of these units
    as the reciprocal second, the use of the different names emphasizes the different
    nature of the quantities concerned. It is especially important to carefully distinguish
    frequencies from angular frequencies, because by definition their numerical values
    differ by a factor of $2\pi$. Ignoring this fact may cause an error of $2\pi$.
    Note that in some countries, frequency values are conventionally expressed using
    “cycle/s” or “cps” instead of the SI unit $Hz$, although “cycle” and “cps” are not
    units in the SI. Note also that it is common, although not recommended, to use the
    term frequency for quantities expressed in $rad/s$. Because of this, it is recommended
    that quantities called “frequency”, “angular frequency”, and “angular velocity” always
    be given explicit units of $Hz$ or $rad/s$ and not $s^{-1}$.


## Strong Angular extensions in the library

The mp-units library strives to define physically-correct quantities and their units to
provide maximum help to its users. As treating angle as a dimensional quantity can lead
to many "trivial" mistakes in dimensional analysis and calculation, it was decided to
provide additional experimental systems of quantities and units that follow the above
approach and treat _angle_ as a base quantity with a base unit of radian and
_solid angle_ as its derived quantity.

As those (at least for now) are not a part of SI, the _plain angle_ and _solid angle_
definitions can be found in a dedicated `angular` system. Those definitions are also used
in the `isq_angle` system of quantities to make the recipes for angle-based quantities
like _torque_ or _angular velocity_ physically correct:

```cpp
using namespace mp_units;
using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;
using mp_units::angular::unit_symbols::deg;
using mp_units::angular::unit_symbols::rad;

const quantity lever = isq_angle::position_vector(20 * cm);
const quantity force = isq_angle::force(500 * N);
const quantity angle = isq_angle::angular_measure(90. * deg);
const quantity torque = isq_angle::torque(lever * force * angular::sin(angle) / (1 * isq_angle::cotes_angle));

std::cout << "Applying a perpendicular force of " << force << " to a " << lever << " long lever results in "
          << torque.in(N * m / rad) << " of torque.\n";
```

The above program prints:

```text
Applying a perpendicular force of 500 N to a 20 cm long lever results in 100 N m/rad of torque.
```

!!! note

    `cotes_angle` is a constant which represents an angle with the value of exactly `1 radian`.
    You can find more information about this constant in [Quincey](../../appendix/references.md#Quincey).
