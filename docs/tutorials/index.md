# Tutorials

Welcome to the **mp-units** tutorials â€” your step-by-step guide to mastering type-safe
physical quantities and units in C++.

Each lesson is:

- **Exercise-driven:** Learn by doing, with real-world scenarios and hands-on code.
- **Type-safe:** Avoid common bugs by leveraging strong types and modern C++ features.
- **Interactive:** Try code snippets live via Compiler Explorer embeds.
- **Incremental:** Progress from basic refactoring to advanced topics like affine spaces
  and `std::chrono` interop.

Whether you're new to physical units in C++ or looking to deepen your expertise, these
practical, type-safe patterns will help you apply **mp-units** in real projects.
