/**
 * @brief Quantity character
 *
 * Scalars, vectors and tensors are mathematical objects that can be used to
 * denote certain physical quantities and their values. They are as such
 * independent of the particular choice of a coordinate system, whereas
 * each scalar component of a vector or a tensor and each component vector and
 * component tensor depend on that choice.
 *
 * A scalar is a physical quantity that has magnitude but no direction. It might
 * be a real or complex number which affects which operations are allowed on a quantity.
 *
 * Vectors are physical quantities that possess both magnitude and direction
 * and whose operations obey the axioms of a vector space.
 *
 * Tensors can be used to describe more general physical quantities.
 * For example, the Cauchy stress tensor possess magnitude, direction,
 * and orientation qualities.
